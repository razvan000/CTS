1. The code is not formatted
2. Methods should be named appropriately in order to give a glimpse on what they do. -> rename "calculate" and "setValue". Also rename "rate" to "interestRate"
3. Inconsistency with naming conventions. Use lower camelcase
4. Define each variable on a single line
5. Use curly brackets even when there is a single instruction
6. Use indentation
7. Use a single space between a function header and the starting bracket before its body (not a newline)
8. Use only one space between the variable type and the variable name
9. Use a space between operators and operands
10. Use an enumeration for the static attributes (STANDARD, BUDGET, PREMIUM, SUPER_PREMIUM)
11. Don t use comments to explain code.
12. Use Interfaces for mandatory methods.
13. Define exceptions that are suited for your need. -> create InvalidLoanValueException class.
14. YAGNI - there is no need to use an additional account object at line 44.
15. Remove magic numbers (365, 0.125)
16. KISS - the method "calculate" does 2 things. create a method for calculating interest
17. The class account does not have single responsibility-> create a printer class and a fees calculator one.
18. Don't define variable unless you really have to use them ('vb' at line 37)
19. Validate all inputs
20. Make attributes private and provide getters.
