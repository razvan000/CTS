Code review

Stage 1: Naming conventions

- rename Clasa1 to something more meaningful
- rename Calculeaza - use small caps
- rename the function arguments 
- rename 'rezultat'
- rename 'valoare'
- format your code

- remove the hard coded values AKA "magic numbers" (0.1f, 0.25f ...)

- validate your input values

- replace if-then-else checks for the productType with switch
- validate input values

Stage 2: KISS, Single Responsibility -> reduce functions complexity
- remove the switch by using a generic approach for each product type
- out-source the validations
- out-source the way the fidelity discount is computed

Stage 3: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
- remove the dependency regarding the validation of input values
- remove the dependency on the static values - they are given by the marketing department
- remove the dependency on the way the fidelity discount is computed
